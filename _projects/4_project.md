During my career break I got a chance to explore my passions and interests outside my academic and professional space. One of them was ART. I self taught art in different mediums like acrylic, goauche, watercolour, oil pastles, brush pens and digital art. Following the suggestions and encouragement of friends and family, I started an Instagram page to share my artwork. Check out my art on [Swatch and Sketch](https://www.instagram.com/swatchandsketch).
