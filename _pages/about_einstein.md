Hi, I’m Saagara, an aspiring AI researcher and engineer with a background in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. Formerly an Applications Engineer at Oracle, I’m now focused on building deep expertise in artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of contributing to the development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).
I’m currently re-entering the field after a career break, immersing myself in AI research, hands-on projects, and advanced learning. This site is my digital workspace—where I document my journey, share insights, publish literature reviews, and reflect on the evolving landscape of AI.
Whether you’re here to read about machine learning fundamentals, explore thought pieces on AGI, or follow along as I build and experiment with intelligent systems, I’m glad you’re here.
